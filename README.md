# Amazon Landing Page Clone

In this project, I have use **HTML** and **CSS** to recreate the familiar clone of Amazon's homepage.

- With **HTML**, I have structure the page by adding elements like headers, search bar, navigation menu, product grids, and footer sections.

* Styled it using **CSS** to achieve the signature Amazon look with colors, fonts, images and layout arrangements. For styling I have picked font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and images from the official Amazon website.
* Have utilize CSS Flexbox or Grid layout techniques to achieve a structured and organized layout for different sections of the landing page.
