# Amazon Landing Page Clone

In this project, I have use **HTML** and **CSS** to recreate the familiar clone of Amazon's homepage.

\* With **HTML**, I have structure the page by adding elements like headers, search bar, navigation menu, product grids, and footer sections.

- Styled it using **CSS** to achieve the signature Amazon look with colors, fonts, images and layout arrangements. For styling I have picked font from **[Google Fonts]** and images from the official Amazon website.
- Have utilize CSS Flexbox or Grid layout techniques to achieve a structured and organized layout for different sections of the landing page.
